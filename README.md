Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing sentiment classification accuracy for U.S. airline tweets using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By addressing limitations in traditional methods like Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF, this system captures semantic relationships and nuances such as negation and sarcasm.

The approach integrates state-of-the-art NLP features, including pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT). An ensemble model combining Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest with Majority Voting ensures robust and accurate predictions.

The project is built upon the publicly available Kaggle Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset and provides actionable insights to help airlines improve their services based on customer feedback.
